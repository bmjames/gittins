# Gittins

Gittins is a simple tool for managing multiple Git repositories.

## Requirements

Building Gittins requires [Cabal][1]. Running it requires [Git][2].

## Usage

Gittins for the impatient: `gittins --help`, `gittins <command>

Gittins for the patient is not written yet.

## Credits

Gittins is inspired by [myrepos][4], but has much less functionality. On the other hand, Gittins is not written in Perl, so I can enjoy hacking on it.
